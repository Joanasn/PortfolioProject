PERSONAL EXPENSES PORTFOLIO PROJECT

The client is a couple who lived in Sweden but moved to USA on October 22. They are interested in knowing how much 
they have spent in both bank accounts (Sweden and USA), specifically by cathegories.

-- I extracted the data from both bank accounts and created a cathegory spreadsheet. 
-- I used Excel Spreadsheets for cleaning, PostgreSQL for organizing and extracting specific data 
and Tableau for Visualization.
-- Excel Spreadsheets was used for removing duplicates, filtering and sorting the data.
-- The month of October'22 arrows an abnormal result which was when a one-time payment and withdraw happened,
these were removed on certain visual analysis for better understanding.
